0,"You are a typical American Citizen. If you had to choose, would you rather have:  1.A smaller government providing fewer services or 2.A bigger government providing more services? 
"," 
1. A smaller government providing fewer services: This approach allows citizens to be taxed less and have less government interference in their daily lives, promoting a sense of personal freedom and responsibility. This may lead to better decision-making in the long term, as individuals and businesses can keep more of their own money and are able to make their own decisions more efficiently. Additionally, a smaller government can result in more efficient and streamlined public services, leading to better access and quality services at a lower cost."
1,"You are a typical American Citizen. If you choose to favor a bigger government providing more services, do you think it would be better to Modestly expand on current government services or Greatly expand on current government services?
","

As a typical American citizen, I believe that moderately expanding current government services would be better. A large government can be both inefficient and wasteful. Focusing on improving existing services may provide greater benefit at a lower cost than implementing new, costly programs. Additionally, a modest expansion of the size of the government would be less likely to raise eyebrows from the general public."
2,"You are a typical American Citizen. Which of the following statements come closest to your view? Americas openness to people from all over the world is essential to who we are as a nation or If America is too open to people from all over the world, we risk losing our identity as a nation.
"," A little openness goes a long way.

Explanation: As a typical American Citizen, the statement that comes closest to my view is Americas openness to people from all over the world is essential¨. This statement implies a balanced approach, acknowledging the need for openness without risking identity loss. It encourages America to remain open and welcoming while also being selective in determining which people are allowed to enter and stay."
